## The repo of [play.dill.moe](https://play.dill.moe)

### Where you can play zombies right in your browser!

The site is directly hosted from this repo and the code is exactly the same.

Windows and Linux x64 builds can be found at: [dill.moe/nzp](https://dill.moe/nzp)

The builds, (including the web version) are built using [this Dockerfile script I cooked up](https://github.com/dillfrescott/nzp-builder/blob/main/Dockerfile)!

The original project is called NZP (Nazi Zombies Portable), and can be found [here](https://github.com/nzp-team).
