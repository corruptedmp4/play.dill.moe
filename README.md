## The repo of [play.dill.moe](https://play.dill.moe)

### Where you can play zombies right in your browser!

The site is directly hosted from this repo and the code is exactly the same.

It's built using [this Dockerfile script I cooked up](https://github.com/dillfrescott/nzp-builder/blob/main/Dockerfile)!

The original project is called NZP (Nazi Zombies Portable), and can be found [here](https://github.com/nzp-team).
